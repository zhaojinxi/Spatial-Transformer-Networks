# Spatial-Transformer-Networks

This is what I implemented [Spatial Transformer Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02025). This implementation refers to the work of others on github. I tried to simplify the code and came with a simple cnn network for testing. The code is based on tensorflow and is launched in eager mode to facilitate checking the entire process.
